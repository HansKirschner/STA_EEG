# STA_EEG

Hi!

Here, you'll find code for the single-trial EEG analysis toolbox, covering both time and time-frequency domains.

Slides from our workshop on advanced EEG analysis techniques, which we hold regularly, are available <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/5oth4gojf3ayuhhwtxwa4/AG6vTRwP3BHVaZWe8HB3Ki4?rlkey=bn563axbcixvw55ac00oiv2rm&st=xkw931t6&dl=0">here</a>

The slides contain detailed descriptions and examples of the toolbox.

All scripts starting with "STA_" are meta-scripts with extensive documentation.

Please refer to the documentation for information on required inputs and optional settings.

Let me know if you encounter any problems or have ideas for extensions.

Cheers,
Hans
